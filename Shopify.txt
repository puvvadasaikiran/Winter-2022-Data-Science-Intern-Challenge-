Question 1A : Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation. Think about a better way to evaluate this data. 

Answer :

The dataset contains the various types of orders (Consumer and Business Orders)
These Business Orders are Bulk Orders which are placed with total_items count of 2000
A Normal Customer might not put an Order that has 2000 items.
These are affecting the average order_amount we are concerned about.
We can better evaluate the Data by filtering out these bulk orders which have an item_count of 2000.

How did i comeup with 2000 ? => when we find Unique values of total_items we can see only 2, 1, 3, 2000, 4, 5, 6, 8
So the Outlier here is 2000

there are 17 Such Orders with total_items 2000 and order_amount 704000$




Question 1B : What metric would you report for this dataset?

Answer :

We can get the better knowledge about consumer purchases if we exclude the bulk orders that are part of the dataset




Question 1C: What is its value?

Answer :

The new Average order value is 754.091913$
